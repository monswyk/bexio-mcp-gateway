## [3.0.0] - 2026-09-25 — Gateway fork

Fork of [promptpartner/bexio-mcp-server](https://github.com/promptpartner/bexio-mcp-server) 2.5.0.

### Added
- **Gateway mode.** With `MCP_MODE=gateway`, one process serves several MCP clients over Streamable HTTP. An admin signs in to Bexio once in the browser. The gateway refreshes that login in the background. Personal access tokens are not used.
- **One access key per client.** The key is stored only as a SHA-256 hash. Adding, replacing, or disabling a client does not need a restart.
- **Admin page** at `/admin`. The password is `GATEWAY_ADMIN_KEY`. It connects or removes a Bexio user.
- **Per-client tool checkboxes.** **List\*** and **Get\*** stay on. **Create\***, **Update\***, and **Delete\*** can be turned off. Update also covers tools that issue, send, mark, or edit. **Save** applies the next time that client connects. A client with no saved choice can call every tool. Replacing the key keeps the choice.
- **`GET /health`** returns `{"status":"ok"}` when a Bexio user is connected, otherwise `{"status":"degraded"}`.

### Changed
- In gateway mode, `list_companies` and `select_company` are not registered. A session uses the Bexio user named for that client.
- `client-add <name> <bexio-user>` records which Bexio user the client acts through.

### Fixed
- The admin **Remove** button accepts the browser form post.

## [2.5.0] - 2026-07-01

### Added — Multiple Bexio companies (mandates) from one server
Bexio binds each API token to a single company, so multi-company users previously had
to run one server instance per company (≈314 tools each in the system prompt). Now **one
instance can hold several companies' tokens and switch between them**, adding just two
tools.
- **`BEXIO_API_TOKENS`** env var configures multiple companies, as JSON
  (`{"Acme":"<token>","Globex":"<token>"}`) or a delimited list
  (`Acme:<token>,Globex:<token>`). **`BEXIO_DEFAULT_COMPANY`** picks the company active at
  startup. The existing single **`BEXIO_API_TOKEN`** still works unchanged.
- **`list_companies`** — shows each configured company's label, real company name, and
  which is active. **`select_company`** — switches the active company; every other tool
  then operates on it ("in Globex, list open invoices"). These two tools are registered
  only when `BEXIO_API_TOKENS` is set, so single-company setups are byte-for-byte
  unchanged (still 314 tools; 316 in multi-company mode).
- In multi-company mode, successful responses include `active_company` in their `meta`
  block so it's always clear which company a result came from.
- The MCP bundle (`.mcpb`) gained optional **Additional companies** and
  **Default company label** config fields.
- Tokens are never logged or returned; `list_companies` exposes labels + company names
  only.

### Notes
- The active company is **process-global** — ideal for the stdio use
  case. For concurrent multi-tenant HTTP deployments, continue running one instance
  per company.

## [2.4.1] - 2026-06-30

### Fixed (7 issues reported against the bill/payment lifecycle — #6–#12, all live-verified)
- **`update_bill` no longer silently destroys data (#7).** Bexio's v4 `PUT /purchase/bills/{id}` replaces the whole bill and drops every field you don't resend — most damagingly `document_no`, whose loss then blocks booking. `update_bill` is now a safe partial update: it fetches the current bill, deep-merges your changes, and writes back only the writable fields (preserving `document_no`). Send the full `line_items` array to change a line; omit it to leave lines untouched.
- **`issue_bill` works (#6).** The old `POST /purchase/bills/{id}/issue` returned 404 (no such sub-path). Booking a DRAFT bill now uses `PUT /purchase/bills/{id}/bookings/BOOKED`.
- **`mark_bill_as_paid` returns actionable guidance instead of a 404 (#6).** Bexio has no mark-as-paid endpoint; a bill is marked paid by recording a payment. The tool now points you to `create_outgoing_payment` with the bill's `bill_id` (which flips the bill to PAID) rather than firing a request that always fails.
- **`update_outgoing_payment` works (#8).** The old `PUT /purchase/outgoing-payments/{id}` returned 405. The update now uses the collection path with `payment_id` in the body and is reduced to the fields Bexio actually accepts (so passing back a full payment object no longer fails). Note: Bexio only allows updating IBAN/QR payments, not MANUAL ones.
- **`create_bill` / `create_outgoing_payment` now document the real fields (#9).** Schemas were corrected from the wrong `contact_id`/`positions` to the actual `supplier_id`, `line_items` (with `booking_account_id`, not `account_id`), structured `address`, `contact_partner_id`, `manual_amount`/`amount_calc`; and for payments `payment_type` (IBAN/QR/MANUAL), `sender_bank_account_id`, `reference_no` (QR) vs `message` (IBAN), `fee_type`.
- **`download_file` no longer overflows context on large files (#10).** Files above a threshold (default 64 KB decoded, override via `BEXIO_DOWNLOAD_INLINE_MAX_BYTES`) are written to disk and the tool returns `file_path` instead of inline base64. Small files still inline (backward-compatible). New optional `output_path` chooses the destination. In HTTP mode the path is on the server host.
- **stdio server no longer orphans (#11).** When the MCP client disconnects (stdin closes) or sends SIGINT/SIGTERM, the process now shuts down and exits instead of lingering with the API token. HTTP mode is unaffected.
- **`create_iban_payment` / `create_qr_payment` warn that they are NOT bill-linked (#12).** Their descriptions now steer you to `create_outgoing_payment` (with `bill_id`) when you actually mean to pay a supplier bill, and a `_hint` is attached to the response. `update_iban_payment` notes a bill cannot be attached afterward.

### Added
- Unit tests (vitest) for the new `mergeBillData` (#7) and `shouldInline`/`writeDownloadToTemp` (#10) logic, plus test infra (`vitest.config.ts`).

## [2.4.0] - 2026-06-16

### Added (314 tools, +4)
- **`get_account_balances` (Saldenliste)** — account balances computed from the accounting journal, since Bexio's API has no native balance endpoint. `balance = sum(debits) − sum(credits)` per account over a date range, enriched with `account_no`/`name`. Defaults to the current business year (includes opening/carry-forward entries, so it reflects the current balance). Optional `account_id` filter and `start_date`/`end_date` override. Paginates the journal with a logged safety cap.
- **`get_currency_exchange_rates`** and **`list_currency_codes`** — wrap the Bexio v3.0 currency exchange-rate and ISO-code endpoints (added by Bexio in 2024) for multi-currency reporting.
- **`get_employee_payslip_pdf`** — fetch one employee's payslip (Lohnabrechnung) as a base64 PDF for a given year/month (`/4.0/payroll/employees/{id}/paystub-pdf/{year}/{month}`), replacing the non-functional `list_payroll_documents` stub (which Bexio's API never supported). Requires the Payroll module.

### Notes
- Account balances are **computed, not authoritative**: the figure equals the live balance when the date range covers the full business year (the default); for partial ranges it is the period movement. Validate against Bexio's own Saldenliste/Kontenblatt.

## [2.3.1] - 2026-06-16

### Fixed (critical — server crashed on startup for everyone)
- **Server no longer crashes during the `initialize` handshake.** v2.3.0 registered the MCP Apps UI panels using `path.join(import.meta.dirname, "ui/ui")`. `import.meta.dirname` only exists on Node ≥ 20.11; on the older Node bundled by some MCP clients it is `undefined`, so `path.join(undefined, …)` threw synchronously inside `initialize()` (before the transport connected), which propagated to the top-level handler and called `process.exit(1)` — killing the process ~50 ms after receiving `initialize`, so **no tools ever appeared**. The UI base path is now resolved via a Node-version-safe helper (`import.meta.url` → `cwd` fallback) that can never throw at registration time.
- Global `uncaughtException` / `unhandledRejection` handlers now log the full stack to stderr (and keep the server alive), so a future peripheral failure is diagnosable instead of a silent exit.

### Changed
- **Interactive UI panels (MCP Apps: `preview_invoice`, `show_contact_card`, `show_dashboard`) are now opt-in.** They register only when `BEXIO_ENABLE_UI=true`, and registration is wrapped in try/catch so a UI failure can never take down the 310 core data tools. Default behaviour: all data tools, no UI.
- `.env` loading is now awaited before environment variables are read (the previous fire-and-forget `import("dotenv")` raced the reads, leaving npm/.env users with an undefined token). MCPB / claude.ai users — whose env is injected by the host — are unaffected. The tool registry is imported after env load so `BEXIO_ENABLED_CATEGORIES` is honoured from `.env` too.
- `serverInfo.version` reported over MCP now matches the package version (was hardcoded `2.0.0`).

## [2.3.0] - 2026-05-28

### Added
- `BEXIO_ENABLED_CATEGORIES` env var: comma-separated whitelist of tool categories to register, to reduce system-prompt token usage for focused workflows or smaller models. Empty/unset registers all tools (backward compatible). Thanks to @Fabrik4 (#5).

### Fixed (write operations & schemas, from live API testing)
Incorporated fixes from @ueliwyss (#4), verified against the live Bexio API:
- Edit operations (quote/order/invoice) use a writable-field whitelist and supply Bexio-required defaults (`nb_decimals_amount`, `nb_decimals_price`, `is_compact_view`) that GET doesn't return, fixing PUT rejections.
- Copy (quote/invoice) sends the required `contact_id` (fetched from the source document).
- Subtotal/pagebreak position creation sends the non-empty body Bexio requires.
- `search_bills` uses GET (Bexio v4.0 rejects POST /search for bills); `search_*` tools accept a `query`/`field`/`operator`/`filters` shape.
- Schema corrections: `create_project` required fields; `create_fictional_user` (`email` required, `salutation_type` male/female); `create_additional_address` uses `street_name`/`house_number`; `create_note` only sends `is_public` when provided; `update_contact_relation` fetch-then-merge for partial updates; `create_timesheet` uses the nested `tracking` object; comments are nested under their document.

### Fixed (Bexio API v3.0/v4.0 endpoint migration)
Bexio retired a large set of v2.0 endpoints; the tools below were calling dead paths (404/400) and now target the current API. Verified live against a real Bexio account except where noted.

- Currencies → `/3.0/currencies`; bank accounts → `/3.0/banking/accounts`
- Calendar years, business years, VAT periods → `/3.0/accounting/{calendar_years,business_years,vat_periods}`
- Permissions → `/3.0/permissions`; current user → `/3.0/users/me`; fictional users → `/3.0/fictional_users` (update is PATCH)
- Document templates → `/3.0/document_templates`; files → `/3.0/files` (update is PATCH; upload/download hit v3.0 directly)
- Invoice reminders → `/2.0/kb_invoice/{id}/kb_reminder` (was `/reminder`, 404)
- Expenses → `/4.0/expenses` (moved out of `/4.0/purchase/expenses`)
- Employees → `/4.0/payroll/employees`; **employee IDs are now UUID strings** (were integers)
- Absences → nested `/4.0/payroll/employees/{employee_id}/absences`; `list_absences` now requires `employee_id` and `business_year`; absence IDs are strings
- `list_outgoing_payments` now requires `bill_id` (Bexio lists outgoing payments per bill; previously returned HTTP 400)
- IBAN/QR payments → nested `/3.0/banking/bank_accounts/{bank_account_id}/...`; `get_*`/`update_*` now require `bank_account_id`
- Project milestones → `/3.0/projects/{id}/milestones`; work packages → `/3.0/projects/{id}/packages`; project unarchive action renamed to `reactivate`
- Quote actions corrected to Bexio's names: decline→`reject`, revert→`revertIssue`, create-order→`order`, create-invoice→`invoice`; order create-delivery→`delivery`, create-invoice→`invoice`
- Contact restore now uses PATCH
- `list_payroll_documents` returns a clear error (Bexio v4.0 has no payroll-documents list endpoint)
- `makeVersionedRequest` now normalizes errors to `McpError` (status-based recovery hints; fixes payroll module availability detection)

### Notes
- **Not live-verified on the test account (HTTP 403 — module/scope restricted):** purchase orders (`/3.0/purchase_orders`), stock locations/areas (`/2.0/stock_place`, `/2.0/stock`). Paths follow the current Bexio API; confirm with an account that has these modules enabled.
- Endpoints still served on v2.0 (contacts, invoices, orders, quotes, accounts, items, notes, tasks, reference data) are unchanged.

## [2.2.1] - 2026-05-27

### Fixed
- **Tool parameters were silently dropped for all parametrized tools.** Tools were registered with an empty input schema, so `tools/list` advertised `properties: {}` to MCP clients. Clients stripped every argument before sending, and handlers then reported each required field as `undefined`. Only parameterless tools worked. Tool definitions' JSON-Schema `inputSchema` is now converted to a Zod shape and passed to the SDK, so the full parameter schema is exposed to clients and arguments reach the handlers (new `src/schema-converter.ts`).
- Stringified numbers sent by clients (e.g. `"170"`, `"100.00"`) are now coerced to numbers at the schema boundary, so write tools like `create_manual_entry` accept them.
- `get_journal` now uses `GET /3.0/accounting/journal` (was the non-existent v2.0 `/journal`, which returned 404).
- Manual entries (`list/create/update/delete_manual_entry`) now use `/3.0/accounting/manual_entries` (was the non-existent v2.0 `/manual_entry`, which returned 404). `get_manual_entry` resolves an entry from the list, since Bexio has no single-entry show endpoint.

## [2.2.0] - 2026-03-03

- Stock locations and stock areas management
- Real users listing and document settings tools
- Additional reference data tools: edit/search for countries, languages, currencies, titles, salutations

### Fixed
- editOrder, editOrderRepetition, and editInvoice now correctly use PUT instead of POST

### Changed
- Tool count expanded from 221 to 310 tools across 25 domain modules

## [2.1.0] - 2026-02-23

### Fixed
- Bills, expenses, and outgoing payments now use Bexio v4.0 API (`/4.0/purchase/bills`, `/4.0/purchase/expenses`, `/4.0/purchase/payments`) — fixes 404 errors from deprecated v2.0 endpoints
- Purchase orders now use Bexio v3.0 API (`/3.0/purchase_order`)

### Changed
- Bill, expense, and outgoing payment IDs are now UUID strings (previously integers) to match v4.0 API
- Outgoing payments use a flat endpoint (no longer nested under bills)
- All v3.0/v4.0 purchase endpoints use PUT for updates (previously POST)

# Roadmap: Bexio MCP v2

## Overview

This roadmap transforms the v1 Bexio MCP server (83 tools, SDK 0.5.0, 2,418-line monolith) into a modern v2 distribution with one-click installation, complete API coverage, and modular architecture. The journey starts with SDK migration and architectural refactoring, expands to full Bexio API coverage across 8 feature domains, and culminates in MCPB packaging for zero-friction installation. Milestone v2.2.0 closes every remaining gap between the official Bexio API and our MCP implementation.

## Milestones

- v2.0/v2.1 MVP & Distribution - Phases 1-7 (shipped 2026-02-03)
- v2.2.0 Complete API Coverage - Phases 8-10 (in progress)

## Phases

**Phase Numbering:**
- Integer phases (1, 2, 3): Planned milestone work
- Decimal phases (2.1, 2.2): Urgent insertions (marked with INSERTED)

Decimal phases appear between their surrounding integers in numeric order.
